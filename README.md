# reactPortfolio
Remaking portfolio page as React SPA
Old Portfolio page located here: https://github.com/keating916/portfolio
I will be remaking each of the projects into react functions, 
and each section of the page as well will be a seperate function. 
Eventually, index.html will render a React class that will pull up each project in a Modal.
